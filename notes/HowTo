## **📋 Prerequisites**

---

## **📝 Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Get the Document from Google Classroom**

1. **Go to your Google Classroom**
2. **Find the assignment** 
3. **Click on the assignment**
4. **Click "Make a copy"** or **"Open"** (depending on how it was set up)
   - If it says "Make a copy": Google will create your personal copy
   - If it says "Open": You'll need to make a copy manually

### **Step 2: Make Your Own Copy (if needed)**

If the document opened as view-only:
1. **Go to File** → **"Make a copy"**
2. **Rename the copy** with the required format:
   ```
   Format: [Assignment Prefix]-[Title]-[your name (last, first)]
   Example: U1T1-printlntvsprint-JohnsonSophia
   ```
3. **Click "Make a copy"**

### **Step 3: CRITICAL - Add the Grading System Email**

🔑 **MOST IMPORTANT STEP:** You must share your document with our automated grading system.

1. **Click the "Share" button** (top-right corner of your Google Doc)
2. **In the "Add people and groups" field, type exactly:**
   ```
   doc-reader@moonlit-balm-402019.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```
3. **Set permission to "Viewer"**
4. **Uncheck "Notify people"** 
5. **Click "Send"**

⚠️ **WARNING:** If you forget this step, your submission will fail!

### **Step 4: Complete Your Assignment**

1. **Fill in all required sections** of the document
2. **Follow the assignment requirements** provided by your instructor
3. **Replace any placeholder text** (like [Your Name], [Your Answer Here], etc.)

### **Step 5: Verify Document Title**

1. **Check that your document title** starts with the assignment prefix
2. **The title should match** what's shown in the Student Portal
3. **Example:** If the portal shows "U1P1", your title should be "U1P1 - blah blah blah.."

### **Step 6: Get Your Document Link**

1. **With your document open, click "Share"** again
2. **Click "Copy link"** button
3. **Verify link sharing settings:**
   - Should say "Anyone with the link can view"
   - If it says "Restricted", click "Change" and select "Anyone with the link"
4. **Copy the full URL** - it should look like:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ABC123xyz.../edit?usp=sharing
   ```

### **Step 7: Submit Through the Student Portal**

1. **Return to the Student Portal**
2. **Go to your dashboard**
3. **Find the correct assignment**
4. **Select "Google Doc" as submission type**
5. **Paste your document URL**
6. **Click "Submit Assignment"**
